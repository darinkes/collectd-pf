collectd-pf is a plugin for the system statistics collection daemon - collectd.
It can collect various counters of the PF itself and also useful informations
about each rule of your ruleset.

= Status
	Works for supported versions, but needs some serious testing.

= Supported OpenBSD Versions
	- OpenBSD 4.5
	- OpenBSD 4.9/Current

= Installation
	1.) install collectd and make sources available
		a.) # cd /usr/ports/sysutils/collectd && make install && make clean
		b.) # cd /usr/ports/sysutils/collectd && make patch

	2.) go to collect-pf directory and build/install the plugin
		$ cd collectd-pf && make
		# cp *.so /usr/local/lib/collectd/

	3.) add types.db of pf
		# cp types.pf.db /usr/local/share/collectd/

	4.) adjust collectd.conf
		a.) Add types.db
			TypesDB     "/usr/local/share/collectd/types.pf.db"
		b.) load Plugins
			LoadPlugin pf
			LoadPlugin pfrules

	5.) start collectd
		# collectd -C /etc/collectd.conf

	6.) check /var/log/daemon for errors

	Note: The pf-device (/dev/pf) is only read-/writeable for root.
	      So collectd has to be started as root.

= GUIs
	If you have a large ruleset you should use collection4 as GUI,
	since Collectd-Web has some serious problems with the amount
	of graphs.

== Collectd-Web
	See patch 0001-add-defs-for-pf-plugin.patch.
	Add these lines to your collectd-web setup or apply
	the patch manually with git.

== Collection4
	See patch 0001-add-pf-graphs-to-collection4.patch
	Add these lines to your collection.conf or apply
	the patch manually with git.

= ToDo
	1.) The limit of DATA_MAX_NAME_LEN might cause problems
	    if rules just differ in the last chars after the
	    64th char.
	2.) Get the output of print_rule should not be stored in
	    the filesystem, else on SD-Cards strange things happen.
	3.) ioctl sometimes fails on SD-Cards
